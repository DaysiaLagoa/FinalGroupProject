     <h1>Core Strengthening</h1>
     <br>
     <br>

    <p>
        <dt>
        <h2>Core for babies and toddlers</h2>
        Gross motor and fine motor development starts with good core strength. It's a very important foundation for kids. 
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        Babies start developing core strength when they play on the floor. Floor time gives opportunities for rolling, lying on the side, and reaching for those little toes! Tummy time strengthens muscles for sitting and for fine motor development in the arms and hands.  
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        Older babies and toddlers develop good core strength with continued floor play, side sitting, and crawling. As they get bigger, they climb and move around all over, inside and outside.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        Toddlers and preschoolers learn to move their body on uneven surfaces, small bikes, and on climbing structures. They are successful on playground equipment and swings. 
        </dt>
        <br>

        <img src="/fitness/fitnessimages/fitnessgroupactivity.jpg" width="330px" height="300px" alt="toddlers exercising together">
    
        <br>
        <br>
    
        <h2>Core for teens</h2>

        <dt>
        Strength training (also called resistance training) is a way to build muscles and strength using free weights, kettlebells, weight machines, resistance bands, or a person's own weight. Teens may want to strength train to improve sports performance, treat or prevent injuries, or improve appearance.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        People who work out with weights can use:
        <br>

        free weights, including barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells. Free weights are portable and inexpensive, but it might take some practice to learn good technique.
        weight machines, which make it easier to follow good technique, but you may have to go to a gym or weight room to use them.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        People can also use resistance bands and even their own body weight (as in push-ups, sit-ups, planks, and squats) for strength training.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        If you haven't started puberty, strength training will help you get stronger but your muscles won't get bigger. After puberty, the male hormone testosterone helps build muscle in response to weight training. Because guys have more testosterone than girls do, they get bigger muscles.
        </dt>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h2>Core for adults</h2>

        <dt>
        Core muscles in the abdomen include the long rectus abdominis muscles in the front; the external and internal obliques on the sides; and a wide, flat girdle in front called the transversus abdominis.
        </dt>
        <br>
        
        <dt>
        In your back, a group of muscles called the erector spinae help you stand up tall. The gluteal muscles in the buttocks help you extend your leg, push off from a starting point, walk, and climb stairs.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        And in the pelvis area, the iliacus and the psoas muscles enable you to lift your legs and remain stable while standing; and the quadratus lumborum, a long muscle on each side, helps you bend to the side and back.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        A good approach to strengthening your core is working several core muscle groups at the same time, just the way you would naturally if you were lifting something or climbing.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        If you haven't worked your core in a long time, start slowly, focusing on the quality of the exercise and gradually increasing the number of times you can do it.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        Unlike some muscle groups that should only be worked out every other day, core muscles can be strengthened daily. The core should always be working. It doesn't need a lot of recovery.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        Remember to do a warm-up before strengthening. March in place for a few minutes and move your arms around to get the blood flowing.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        After strengthening, stretch your muscles, especially the hip flexors in the front of your pelvis and the hamstrings in the backs of the thighs.
        </dt>
        <br>

        <dt>
        We want the core muscles to be short and tight.
        </dt>

    <h1>Team Building</h1>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
    <h3>Team-building activities for kids are a fantastic way to help them develop essential skills like communication, cooperation, and problem-solving. Here are some fun and engaging activities you can try:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
    Seeing Spots: Place a colored sticker dot on each child's forehead without them knowing the color. They must find others with the same color without speaking. This encourages non-verbal communication and teamwork.</li>
<br>

    <li>
    Elbow Pass: Kids pass a ball or object using only their elbows. This silly activity helps them make new friends and learn to work together.</li>
<br>

    <li>
    Common Thread: Divide kids into small groups and have them find something they all have in common. Then, they create a flag representing that common element. This helps them get to know each other better. </li>
<br>

    <li>
    Fingertip Hula-Hoop: Kids stand in a circle with their index fingers extended, holding a Hula-Hoop. They must lower the hoop to the ground without dropping it, promoting coordination and teamwork.</li>
<br>

    <li>Human Knot: Kids stand in a circle, hold hands with two different people, and try to untangle themselves without letting go. This classic game teaches communication and reliance on teammates.
<br>

</ol>

     <h1>Gymnastics</h1>
    <br>

     <p> 
        Children accomplish more milestones from ages 1 to 4 than at any other time in their life. From walking, to jumping, to balancing, physical activity is the best way to encourage the development of gross motor skills from an early age. As a result, many parents opt for recreational sports and extracurricular activities, including gymnastics classes. In fact, the Nationwide Children's Hospital states, “More than 600,000 children participate in school-sponsored and club-level gymnastics competitions annually in the United States.” Gymnastics is a popular activity that continues to attract more young girls and boys every day. 
    <br>
    <br>
        However, many parents are curious about the physical benefits of gymnastics for toddlers and are also concerned about the potential risks. So, we're addressing the most popular questions about toddler and preschool gymnastics. Her's everything you need to know to decide if gymnastics is right for your child.
        Putting your child in gymnastics is a decision that shouldn't be taken lightly. Gymnastics affects a young child's physical development and cognitive development.

    <br>
    <br>

    <img src="/fitness/fitnessimages/fitness.jpg" alt="toddlers stretching in fitness group">
    <br>
    <br>

<ol> 
    <li>
    The Purpose of Gymnastics Classes 
    When considering a gymnastics program, most people think about back handsprings or spinning around uneven bars. However, that's not the purpose of gymnastics for young children, especially toddlers. Instead, toddler gymnastics focuses on child development and encourages the development of self-esteem, spatial awareness and self-confidence. It's important to think about what benefits could be meaningful to your child in particular, and to talk to them about what they might want to get out of taking the classes.</li>
    <br>

    <li>
    Age-Appropriate Classes 
    Finding an age-appropriate class is vital in keeping little ones safe. At a young age, classes should be based on age rather than development. While a 4-year-old may be more developmentally advanced than a 2-year-old, they're all still growing and learning to control their body. According to USA Gymnastics, “Preschoolers are commonly placed in a specific gymnastics class by their age, not their ability. Preschool gymnastics directors and teachers develop their curriculum with age-appropriate activities in mind.” While USA Gymnastics believes children will benefit from gymnastics at any age, they point out that “children develop their fundamental movement skills between the ages of 2 and 5,” making it an ideal starting age.</li>
 </ol> 
<br>
<br>

<h2>Benefits for toddlers</h2>
<br>
<br>
    <img src="/fitness/fitnessimages/gymnastics.jpg" alt="helping toddlers with gymnastics">

<br>
<br>

<ol>
    <li>
    Physical Development 
    Depending on your toddler's age, you may see changes in their physical development within a few weeks of starting gymnastics, including improvements to their core strength, coordination, and balance. With continued classes, it can encourage hand-eye coordination, visual tracking, and other fine motor skills.</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>
    Social Skills 
    USA Gymnastics recognizes that developing healthy social skills is especially important for younger toddlers. “The social skills of sharing, helping others, and listening politely are as important to learn as gymnastics skills. Gymnastics classes are typically youngsters' first experience with a "school" setting. Gymnastics classes for this age group caters to the children's need for social development as well as movement education.”</li>

    <br>
    
    <li>
    Other Health Benefits 
    There are always a plethora of mental and physical health benefits when a child moves and gets active. Regular exercise is excellent for preventing certain diseases later in life, such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and more. Since gymnastics is a weight-bearing activity, it encourages strong and healthy bones. We naturally lose bone density as we get older, so strong bones may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in the future. In addition, with stronger bones, children could be less likely to break a bone when they fall over in the playground.</li>

   </ol> 
   <br>
   <br>

    <h2>Benefits for teens & adults</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
        <img src="fitness/fitnessimages/teengymnastics.jpg" alt="teen gymnastics team">
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <ol>
        <li>
        <h2>Increases Flexibility</h2>
         One of the most common benefits that people associate with gymnastics is flexibility. And it’s indeed a core element of the sport. Flexible muscles are longer and more elastic, which helps to improve agility, posture, and muscle coordination while also decreasing the risk of injury. To increase flexibility, gymnasts learn to perform a wide range of motions, such as backbends and splits. 
        </li>
    
        <br>

        <li>
        <h2>Develops Balance and Precision</h2>
        Gymnasts learn to run, jump, and perform acrobatic skills on many pieces of apparatus including a narrow balance beam that's only 4 inches wide and 16.5 feet long. These exercises are important lessons in balance and control. Balance is essential for improving the body's reflexive responses and overall alertness and reducing susceptibility to sprains and injuries from falls. 
        <br>
        <br>

        A 2017 study also found that balance training significantly improved the memory of adults as well as their understanding and perception of their surroundings. </li>
        <br>

        <li>
        <h2>Increases Bone Density</h2>
        Gymnastics involves a lot of weight-bearing exercises and movements, from skills as simple as a handstand to more challenging skills such as front and back handsprings. Over time these types of activities are instrumental to improving bone density, which helps protect against injury and susceptibility to falls, fractures, and frailty later in life.</li>   
        <br>

        <li>
        <h2>Reduces Depression</h2>
        Gymnastics can also lower anxiety and depression. There are several reasons for this. When you engage in physical exertion, your body releases endorphins that make you feel good. Physical activity also distracts you from negative thoughts and feelings by forcing you to be in the moment and only focus on your body's movements.
        <br>
        <br>  
        In 2018, a study conducted on postpartum women found that only four weeks of aerobic gymnastic exercise helped reduce feelings of fatigue and stress significantly and improve sleep quality. And although they engaged in the activities for only four weeks, the effects lasted for twelve weeks.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
            <img src="fitness/fitnessimages/teenadultgym.jpg" alt="teen and adult gymnast group">
        <br>
        <br>

        <li>
        <h2>Elevates Spatial Awareness</h2>
        Not many recognize the significance of spatial awareness as a skill, but spatial thinking is vital in the area of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Simply put, spatial awareness is the ability to mentally picture, understand, and navigate the space around you from different angles. Having a better sense of your surroundings has the added effect of enhancing your intuition.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the world of gymnastics, you instinctively know if you haven't leaped high enough to execute a move or if you've somersaulted too close to the edge of the floor. In other areas of life, spatial awareness provides you with a good sense of direction and also helps with driving vehicles.</li>
        <br>

        <li>
        <h2>Improves Memory</h2>
        Gymnastic routines can be long and intricate, and gymnasts may need to remember several of them simultaneously. By regularly learning, performing, and repeating choreographed moves, children can significantly boost their memory skills and cognitive function. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the act of exercising itself also helps to improve memory. Many studies show that a good memory increases learning, which leads to a reduction in stress and anxiety because understanding and recollection are easier.</li>

        What you may not realize is that yoga is as crucial for you as it is for your child's growing mind and body. You may have experienced your child emulating poses while you were practicing when they were tots, but encouraging them to do and try yoga as they grow will bring you closer together, all while helping them through the many stages of development.

        While you exercise in water, you may not notice how much you're sweating. This can make it seem like you're not working as hard as you actually are and can lead to dehydration if you are not careful. You should always drink lots of water before and after a pool workout to rehydrate your body.
    <br>
        If you cannot swim well, you should also avoid exercises that must be performed without a flotation device. Since pools sometimes are heated, choosing one that is 90 degrees F or below is essential so you don't get overheated while exercising.

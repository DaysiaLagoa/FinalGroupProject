    <p>In the Psychology of Play course, Parents Care will explore how the field of psychology values the concept of play as a mechanism that allows a person to apply game strategies to accomplish life goals. Parents Care will examine how the action of play shapes the brain, develops critical-thinking skills, and strengthens the ability to collaborate with others in social and professional settings. By exploring the key works of historical and current researchers and theorists, Parents Care will learn about the value of play and how to apply techniques of play in developing cognitive strategies to complete creative, professional, and social tasks. This course enables children to utilize perspectives in psychology to examine how play relates to their life, education, and chosen creative field.</p>

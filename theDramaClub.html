            Welcome to The Drama Club at Parents Care, where we elevate early childhood development through the transformative power of theatre. Our program is designed to enrich the bond between parents and children by emphasizing uninterrupted quality time and the importance of play. Through creative drama activities, children experience a boost in creativity, communication skills, and self-confidence. Our theatre-based approach fosters empathy by allowing kids to explore diverse perspectives and develop a deeper understanding of others. We promote teamwork and collaboration, while also enhancing problem-solving abilities and emotional expression. By incorporating these dynamic elements into our curriculum, the Drama Department at Parents Care ensures that both parents and children enjoy meaningful, enriching interactions that support holistic development and strengthen their connection
